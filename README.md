(fill in your description and goals here)

## Process
### EXTRACT

1. In the first step I had to get the network name for Bike Share Toronto. There for I made an API call to 'https://api.citybik.es/v2/networks' in order to get all the network names. Stored the results in df_networks.csv

2. From the newtork names, bixi-toronto is the network names to be used. Therefore, I made an API call to "https://api.citybik.es/v2/networks/bixi-toronto" to get the stats for bike stations in toronto.

3. Parsing through the list of latitudes and longitudes from above, I initiated my API call to Foursquare to get POIs.

4. In order to make an API call to Foursquare radius are required:

f"https://places-api.foursquare.com/places/search?ll={latitude},{longitude}&radius={radius}&fsq_category_ids={categories}"

I obtained my category IDs from: https://docs.foursquare.com/data-products/docs/categories with Park, Bar and Restaurent being desired categories.


### LOAD

1. For each row in my city_bikes datarame, I made an API call to Foursquare using Lat and Long in that row in order to compile a list if dictionaries with station_id as index, place_name, lat, long, address and category

2. This was built into a dataframe and stored in fsqr_response.csv


### TRANSFORM

1. Eventhough 3 major categories were selected, Foursquare still returned 531 unique sub-categories
2. In order to clean up the data, 5 major categories Bar/Rstaurant, Bar, Restaurant, Park and Other were assigned to each row.
3. city_bikes and category_counts were merged using station_id as key, in order to conduct EDA and run the regression model

## Results
Based on the coverage of API in my area, I was not able to find a strong evidence in my statsmodel with p values (except for Bar/Restaurent) being relatively larger than Î±

However, Poisson regression seemed to respond better showing correlation with Bar/Restaurent and Park

## Challenges 
Main challenges in this project:

1. Limit on API calls to Foursquare. I had to be very conservative and considerate with making those calls, which had an impact on how well I could experiment

2. Inconsistency in Foursquare sub-categories (over 500 unique subcategories were returned) and this forced me to create my own categories

3. It was not possible for me to create a  trial subscription with Yelp due to their requirement for a business email
## Future Goals
I would have explored other regression models and used a more granular category level from Foursquare.
